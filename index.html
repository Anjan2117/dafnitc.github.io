            8 year old Aisha meant the world to her parents, the source of happiness and joy. She is now suffering from Wilson's disease, and admitted to Global Hospital,Chennai. Due to her critical condition she urgently needed a liver transplant to survive and her parents were in need of money for the operation. We decided to take up this project to support Aisha and raised funds from our near and dear ones and planned to go meet her parents personally.
            
            Our fellow foundation members Ravi, Raghu and Koushik met Aisha's parents to know about the health condition of Aisha, got to know she was admitted into ICU and the operation scheduled for 28th Sept. Next day, our team visited them again and handed over a sum of Rs. 20,000 towards hospital expenses to Aisha's mother and taken her for dinner and giving moral support that Aisha would come back home stale and healthy. She thanked us for all the love and support given to Aisha.</p>

           <p>Bags Distribution to Elementary School Students.

            The Elementary Government school is located in Gadala, near to Rajamundry, in East Godavari district. The school primarily comprises of underprivilaged students who defy odds to go to school everyday.

We decided to provide school bags and motivate the budding champs, who struggle to go to school everyday .
            
            All our near and dear ones came forward to support the cause, crowd funded an amount of Rs. 15,000. School bags were distributed to all the 100 children studying in the school through the hands of their class teachers.
            
            The school teachers have thanked the Dreams Alive foundation for the support received and wished success in all the future endevours of the foundation.</p>
